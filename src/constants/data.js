export const aboutContent = {
  earlyLife: `
    Harmeet Singh was born and raised in Gwalior, a city known for its rich cultural and musical heritage. His formative years at The Scindia School laid the foundation for a holistic approach to art and creativity. Later, his education at Sydenham College in Mumbai expanded his horizons and introduced him to the vibrant entertainment industry of the city.
    
    Growing up in a family that appreciated music, Harmeet developed an ear for melody from a young age. His formal training in classical music combined with an innate ability to understand contemporary trends would later become his signature style.
  `,

  journey: `
    Harmeet's journey in the music industry began with television appearances where his talent quickly caught the attention of producers and directors. What started as small compositions for television programs gradually evolved into full-fledged music direction for films.
    
    The formation of Meet Bros marked a significant milestone in his career, allowing him to collaborate and create music that would soon dominate the Indian music charts. The transition from a duo to establishing his individual identity as Harmeet Meet showcases his versatility and commitment to musical exploration.
  `,

  musicStyle: `
    Harmeet Meet's musical style defies simple categorization. His compositions range from high-energy club anthems that dominate dance floors to soulful ballads that touch hearts. This versatility has allowed him to work across various film genres and independent projects.
    
    His approach to music production combines traditional Indian instruments with contemporary electronic sounds, creating a unique fusion that appeals to diverse audiences. His keen sense of current musical trends, coupled with a deep respect for classical elements, results in compositions that feel both fresh and timeless.
  `,

  socialImpact: `
    Beyond entertainment, Harmeet has used his platform to advocate for mental health awareness through the WeCare Initiative. The tragic loss of his friend, actor Kushal Punjabi, to depression in 2019 motivated him to speak openly about mental health issues in the entertainment industry.
    
    Through benefit concerts, awareness campaigns, and personal advocacy, he continues to emphasize the importance of mental wellbeing, particularly among artists and creative professionals who often face unique pressures and challenges.
